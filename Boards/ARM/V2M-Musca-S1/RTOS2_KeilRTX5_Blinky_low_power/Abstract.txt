The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS-RTOS2 Keil RTX5 based example for
ARM 'Musca-S1 CM33 #0' device using ARM 'V2M-Musca-S1' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =          50.00 MHZ
   - SYSCLK  =          50.00 MHz

 - one LED is flashing  with a fixed speed.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Source'

Debug (QSPI):             Debug (eMRAM):
--------------------      ----------------------
  code: QSPI Flash          code: eMRAM
  data: eMRAM               data: eMRAM
  idle: eMRAM off           idle: eMRAM off
        SRAM off                  SRAM off
        + sleepdeep               + sleepdeep

How it works:
  SRAM3 is used as 'ULP RAM' which means that it is active during power down phase.
  Code and Data for ulp_* files are placed in ULP RAM because code is used to enter and leave power down phase.
  Interrupt vecors are copied to ULP RAM because S32K Timer interrupt is used for wake up.
  Main stack is placed in ULP RAM.
  Process stack is placed in ULP RAM during pwer down phase.
  OS Idle Thread checks if system can enter power down phase.
