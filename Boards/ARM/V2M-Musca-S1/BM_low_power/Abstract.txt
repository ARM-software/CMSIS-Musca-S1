The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for the Arm 'Musca-S1 CM33 #0' device
on the Arm 'V2M-Musca-S1' evaluation board. The example is compliant to CMSIS.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =          50.00 MHZ
   - SYSCLK  =          50.00 MHz

 - one LED is flashing in three different colors with a fixed speed.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1

Debug (eMRAM):            Debug (SRAM):
----------------------    ----------------------
  code: eMRAM               code: SRAM
  data: SRAM                data: SRAM
  idle: eMRAM auto off      idle: eMRAM auto off
        + sleepdeep               + sleepdeep

How to use it:
- Configure the board's BOOT switch to "MRAM".
- Build the Debug (SRAM) target.
- Go to debug to load the application into RAM
- Run until it stops, Run again. LED should show three colors interchangeably.
- Exit debug without stopping.
- Enter "Energy measurement without debug" mode
- See power readings in the System Analyzer window

Error handling:
- If application does not start at the first instance, exit debug, power cycle
  the device, and start over again
