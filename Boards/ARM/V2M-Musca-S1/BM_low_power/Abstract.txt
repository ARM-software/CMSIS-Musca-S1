The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for the Arm 'Musca-S1 CM33 #0' device
on the Arm 'V2M-Musca-S1' evaluation board. The example is compliant to CMSIS.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =          50.00 MHZ
   - SYSCLK  =          50.00 MHz

- one LED is flashing in three colors during different program phases:
   - Red    - code execution in SRAM
   - Green  - code execution in eMRAM
   - Yellow - Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) mode

The Blinky program is available in different targets
 - Debug (eMRAM) - main code and data are in eMRAM
 - Debug (SRAM)  - main code and data are in SRAM

In both targets the code for ultra-low power operation
is kept in SRAM area that is not being turned off during ULP.

The application executes simple counting in SRAM and eMRAM. Timing and
current consumption can be compared in SystemAnalyzer using ULINKplus.

Debug (eMRAM):            Debug (SRAM):
----------------------    ----------------------
  code:     eMRAM                code:     SRAM
  ulp code: SRAM                 ulp code: SRAM	
  data:     eMRAM                data:     SRAM

How to use it:
 - Configure the board's BOOT switch to "MRAM".
 - Build the Debug (SRAM) target.
 - Go to debug to load the application into SRAM
 - Run debug. LED should show three colors interchangeably.
 - Exit debug without stopping.
 - Enter "Energy measurement without debug" mode
 - See power readings in the System Analyzer window
 - Repeat the previous steps with the taget Debug (MRAM)
   in this case code and data are kept in MRAM (except of SRAM count and ULP parts)
