TF-M Project Template
---------------------

Target: Musca-S1 running from eMRAM

Configuration:
 - SFN Mode (Secure Functions aka Library Mode)
 - Isolation Level 1

Workspace contains the following projects:
 - tfm_s:  TF-M firmware with secure services running on the secure side
 - tfm_ns: Template for application running on the non-secure side

TF-M firmware on the secure side runs first and then transfers execution
to the non-secure application.

Running the example:
 - connect the board via USB DAPLink Port to the PC
 - use console on the PC via UART @115200bps (optional)
 - build project for the secure side (tfm_s)
 - build project for the non-secure side (tfm_ns)
 - start the debug session and run the target
